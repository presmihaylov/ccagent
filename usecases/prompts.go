Follow these strict rules:
- Maximum 50 characters (STRICT LIMIT)

- docs: documentation changes
- refactor: code restructuring without behavior change
- chore: maintenance, dependencies, configuration
- test: adding or fixing tests
- perf: performance improvements
- ci: CI/CD pipeline changes
- build: build system or external dependencies
- style: formatting, missing semicolons (no code change)

Examples:
- "fix: resolve error handling in message processor"
